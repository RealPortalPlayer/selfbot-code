# Self-Bot
A bot that actually isn't what the title says it is.

This took me a while to make so please, credit me if you're going to use this.
## How to install
First make a .env file, and put this in it:
```
TOKEN=discord token
CATDOGTOKEN=place cat and dog token
```
To get a `cat and dog` token, click [here](https://thecatapi.com/signup) and put the info in and you will get a token in your email once you do it.

Then open up a console, then type `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

Before you are done, please go to `data/api/settings/botsettings.js` and edit everything inside it.

Then type `npm start` to start it! The website source code will be released soon, once I finish it.
